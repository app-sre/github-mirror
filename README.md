# GitHub Mirror

GitHub API mirror that caches the responses and implements
[conditional requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests),
serving the client with the cached responses when the GitHub API replies with a
304 HTTP code, reducing the number of API calls, making a more efficient use of
the GitHub API rate limit.

The mirror acts only on GET requests, by-passing the other requests methods.

Github Mirror can cache responses either locally in-memory or in Redis.
The in-memory cache is shared among all the threads, but not
shared between processes. Every time the server is started, the cache is
initialized empty.
Using Redis prevents the cache from being lost when the github mirror server is restarted.

## Use

Build the Docker image:

```
$ docker build -t github-mirror .
```

Run the Docker container:

```
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 github-mirror
[2020-02-16 21:06:04 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4
[2020-02-16 21:06:04 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080 (1)
[2020-02-16 21:06:04 +0000] [1] [INFO] Using worker: threads
[2020-02-16 21:06:04 +0000] [8] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8
```

Use it as Github API url:

```
$ python
Python 3.6.10 (default, Dec 20 2019, 00:00:00)
[GCC 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)] on linux

>>>
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get('http://localhost:8080/repos/app-sre/github-mirror')
<Response [200]>
>>>
>>> requests.get('http://localhost:8080/repos/app-sre/github-mirror')
<Response [200]>
>>>
```

After those two requests, the server log will show:

```
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 github-mirror
[2020-02-16 21:06:04 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4
[2020-02-16 21:06:04 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080 (1)
[2020-02-16 21:06:04 +0000] [1] [INFO] Using worker: threads
[2020-02-16 21:06:04 +0000] [8] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8
2020-02-16 21:08:07,948 [GET] CACHE_MISS https://api.github.com/repos/app-sre/github-mirror
2020-02-16 21:08:13,585 [GET] CACHE_HIT https://api.github.com/repos/app-sre/github-mirror
```

If you're using PyGithub, you have to pass the `base_url` when creating
the client instance:

```
>>> from github import Github
>>> gh_cli = Github(base_url='http://localhost:8080')
```

## Redis mode

To use the mirror with a Redis cache,

Set the cache type as Redis:
```
$ export CACHE_TYPE=redis
```

Run Redis is in a Docker container:
```
$ docker run --rm -it -p 6379:6379 redis
```

A Redis server will be running at `locahost` and port `6379`. Follow the previous [steps](#Use)  to run the mirror server.

## Redis configurations

To connect to a Redis server at an address and port other than the default values, set the following environment variables:

- `PRIMARY_ENDPOINT` is the primary endpoint or host address of the Redis service. If not set, it defaults to `localhost`.
- `READER_ENDPOINT` is the read-only replica endpoint and can be used to increase the read availability of the Redis service. If not set, it defaults to the same address as the primary endpoint.
- `REDIS_PORT` is the port which the Redis service binds to. The default port is `6379`.
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` is the authentication token to access a password protected Redis server. If not set, the default is no authentication.
- `REDIS_SSL` should be set to `True` if you are encrypting the traffic to the Redis server. If not set, the default assumes no encryption.

## Metrics

The service has a `/metrics` endpoint, exposing metrics in the Prometheus
format:

```
>>> response = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/metrics')
>>> print(response.content.decode())
...
http_request_total 2.0
...
request_latency_seconds_count{cache="MISS",method="GET",status="200"} 1.0
...
request_latency_seconds_count{cache="HIT",method="GET",status="200"} 1.0
...
```

## User Validation

To enable the user validation, the `GITHUB_USERS` environment variable
should be available to the server. The `GITHUB_USERS` is a colon-separated
list of authorized users to have their requests to the Github Mirror served.

The user validation, when enabled, will not allow unauthenticated requests
to the Github Mirror.

Please notice that, in order to validate the user, one additional get request
is made to the Github API, to the `/user` endpoint, using the provided
authorization token. That call will also go through the caching mechanism, so
the rate limit will be preserved when possible.
